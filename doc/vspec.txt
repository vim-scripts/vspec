==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*vspec-introduction*

*vspec* is a Vim library plugin to test Vim script.


Requirements:
- Vim 7.2 or later

Latest version:
http://github.com/kana/vim-vspec

Document in HTML format:

==============================================================================
INTERFACE					*vspec-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXTERNAL COMMANDS				*vspec-external-commands*

						*bin/vspec*
bin/vspec {input-script} [{non-standard-runtimepath} ...]
			Utility command to test Vim script with vspec.

			{input-script} is the path to a file which is a test
			script written with vspec.

			{non-standard-runtimepath} is the path to a directory
			to use as a part of 'runtimepath' while executing
			{input-script}.

			Examples:
>
				$ ./bin/vspec test/context.input .
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS					*vspec-commands*

:It {message}					*:It*
			Describe a group of expectations (which are described
			by |:Should|).

			{message} is a string which represents a description
			of expectations after :It.  This message is just used
			for output.

			Examples:
>
				:It "should match case-sensitively"
				:Should 'abc' =~ 'a'
				:Should 'abc' !~ 'A'
<

:ResetContext					*:ResetContext*
			Reset the current context of a script with one saved
			by |:SaveContext|.

			To use this feature, you have to tell "scope" hint to
			vspec with |vspec#hint()|.

:SaveContext					*:SaveContext*
			Save the current context of a script, i.e., an
			snapshot of script-local variables defined in the
			script.  See also |:ResetContext|.

			:SaveContext is automatically executed whenever
			|vspec#hint()| is called with "scope" hint.

			To use this feature, you have to tell "scope" hint to
			vspec with |vspec#hint()|.

:Should {actual} {matcher} {expected}		*:Should*
			Describe an expectation - test whether {actual} value
			matches with {expected} value, in a sense of
			{matcher}.

			{actual} and {expected} is an arbitrary Vim script
			|expression| with the following limitation:

			- Comparing operators, such as ==, !~, etc, cannot be
			  used in {actual} and {expected}.  See |expr4| for
			  the list of comparing operators in Vim script.

			{matcher} is a comparing operator, such as ==, !~,
			etc, which is described in |expr4|.

			You have to insert one or more spaces between
			{actual}, {matcher} and {expected}.

			Examples:
>
				:Should 'abc' =~# 'A'
				" ==> good
				:Should 'abc' =~? 'A'
				" ==> bad

				:Should {} == {}
				" ==> good
				:Should {} isnot {}
				" ==> bad
<
						*vspec-custom-matcher*
			If {matcher} is "be", :Should acts in another mode.
			{expected} is treated as an alias of a function which
			is called "custom matcher".  The custom matcher
			corresponding to {expected} is called with {actual}
			value.  It must return true if {actual} value is
			valid, otherwise it must return false.  See also
			|vspec#customize_matcher()|.

			Examples:
>
				function! True(actual_value)
				  return (type(a:actual_value) == type(0)
				  \       ? a:actual_value
				  \       : !!0)
				endfunction
				call vspec#customize_matcher('true',
				\                            function('True'))

				:Should 123 be true
				" ===> good
				:Should [123] be true
				" ===> bad
<
					    *vspec-predefined-custom-matchers*
			The following custom matcheres are predefined:

			"true"
				Return true if {actual} value is true.
			"false"
				Return true if {actual} value is false.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTIONS					*vspec-functions*

Call(...)					*Call()*
			Alias of |vspec#call()|.

Ref(...)					*Ref()*
			Alias of |vspec#ref()|.

Set(...)					*Set()*
			Alias of |vspec#set()|.

vspec#call({funcname}, [{arg}, ...])		*vspec#call()*
			Like |call()|, but vspec#call() can call
			a script-local function defined in a script to be
			tested.

			{funcname} is a string which represents the name of
			a function.  If {funcname} starts with 's:', it calls
			a script-local function defined in a script to be
			tested.  To use this feature, you have to tell
			"sid" hint to vspec with |vspec#hint()|.


			{arg} is an arbitrary value which is given to the
			function corresponding to o{funcname}.

vspec#customize_matcher({alias}, {function})	*vspec#customize_matcher()*
			Register {function} as a |vspec-custom-matcher| which
			alias is {alias}.

vspec#hint({info})				*vspec#hint()*
			Tell vspec "hint" information to use useful API to
			test a Vim script.

			{info} is a dictionary.  Each key is a string.  The
			detail of this dictionary is as follows:

			"sid"		(optional)
				A string which is evaluated to <SID> of
				a script to be tested.

				If this value is given, you can use
				|vspec#call()|.

			"scope"		(optional)
				A string which is evaluated to the dictionary
				corresponding to s: (= the scope of
				script-local variables) for a script.

				If this value is given, you can use
				|vspec#ref()| and |vspec#set()|.

vspec#ref({varname})				*vspec#ref()*
			Return the value of a variable.

			{varname} is a string which represents the name of
			a script-local variable defined in a script to be
			tested.  The name must start with 's:'.  To use this
			feature, you have to tell vspec to "scope" hint with
			|vspec#hint()|.

vspec#set({varname}, {value})			*vspec#set()*
			Assign {value} to a variable.  See |vspec#ref()| for
			the details of {varname}.

vspec#test({specfile})				*vspec#test()*
			|:source| {specfile}, test expectations described in
			{specfile}, then output a result of the test.
